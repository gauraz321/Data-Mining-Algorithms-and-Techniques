# Data-Mining-Algorithms-and-Techniques

Using Weka, perform data cleaning i.e noise removal, handle missing data, discretization for analysis of the 'Health insurance and Hour Worked by Wives' and 'Deaths from Homicides and Suicides' datasets.

Classification techniques like J48Tree, REPTree & MLP, Association Rule mining & FP-Tree for market basket analysis, K-Means & DBSCAN clustering, and time-series forecasting.
Comparison of training & testing sets performance metrics of algorithms used to produce analysis results.
